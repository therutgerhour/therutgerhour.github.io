<h1>This UX story is purely fictional.</h1>
<br>
<p>Hello. Let me tell you the story of User X.</p>
<img src="images/userXface.jpg" style="width:500px;height:500px;">
<br>
<p>User X was a fine upstanding young man. He enjoyed music, especially the classics. 
One day User X decided to buy music online instead if streaming it through trax.com(generic streaming service). So User X decided to make his way to BuyMusic.com. A modest website that provided users an OK selection. He then did what all users do and searched for his favorite band, Pearl Jam. He typed "Pearl Jam" into the search box and their newest and most popular album appeared along with suggestions of other artists that could be categorized along with PJ. This made User X unhappy, he felt like he himself was being categorized. He then decided to lace up his airwalks and stroll down to his local record shop. Good for him.</p>
<br>
<p>The moral of User X's story is, that if you provide a bad experience to anyone, they are likely to choose an Alternative route.</p>
